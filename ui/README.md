# UI Component

This directory will contain the front-end UI for the Recipe Manager application.

**Note**: Detailed UI requirements are not available yet.

## Structure
- `src/` - Source code
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `pages/` - Page components
  - `assets/` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
  - `services/` - API service integrations
- `public/` - Public static files
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for the UI

To use this UI, you would:

* Install dependencies with ```npm install```
* Start the development server with ```npm start```
* Or build for production with ```npm run build```
* Deploy with Docker using the provided Dockerfile

The UI will communicate with the API according to the routes and endpoints defined in the API requirements.
